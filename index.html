    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! My name is Angel Maynor. I am a Marine Corps brat, meaning that my father served in the Marine Corps.<br>My most favorite place that I lived was Okinawa, Japan. <br>I attended to Craven Community College in New Bern, NC where I obtained an Associate in Arts degree. 
        <br>
        From Craven, I transferred to Winston-Salem State Univeristy in Winston-Salem, NC, where I am currently still at.<br>I am Senior Information Technology major, and also enrolled in my schools early masters program!
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        My hobbies include traveling, exercise, and eating. I love traveling! I have traveled cross-country, from Florida to California by car twice.<br> My high school volleyball team in Japan travelled to Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, South Korea! I have also been to different islands in Japan.
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoy going to the gym. This year my goal is to be consistent in going and making it a top priority.<br>Since I have started working out I have had more energy and have slowly started losing weight.
        <br>
        <br>
        Food is my weakness. It is always nice to find a good restaurant in town that hits the spot.<br> I like all types of cuisine, but my favorite are Japanese, Indian, and sould food.<br>As far as sweets go, I have been obssessed with Crumbl Cookies!
